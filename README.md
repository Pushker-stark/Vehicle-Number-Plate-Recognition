2.indian_licence_plate.xml: Cascade file for making contour.

3.main.py - the script version of jupyter notebook.

4.myModelpn.h5: The final  perfect model that as possible we could .

5.ourModel.h5: that's our previous model not used on finally in the notebook.

6.new_main.ipynb : The jupyter notebook thats were our final codes are written.
